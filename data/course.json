It continues to cover a range of activities including logo creation. Font-end design in this sense concerns aesthetic appeal and marketing. Font-end designers attract viewers using images, color and typography. However, Font-end designers working in user experience (UX) design must justify stylistic choices regarding, say, image locations and font with a human-centered approach"

        "details": "Data Analytics is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that 'learn', that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2] Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision"
